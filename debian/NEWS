linuxinfo (2.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The arm support is now under heavy development (after more than 10
  years of probably broken support).

  If you have an arm machine, please send me the results of
  linuxinfo, preferably with a brief description and using 
  reportbug.

  For more background, please read
